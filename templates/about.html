    <h1>About CutStack</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>CutStack</strong> was born out of a frustration with the complex, expensive, and clunky software
        typically required for print imposition.
        Whether you are a small print shop owner, a graphic designer, or a DIY enthusiast making zines, preparing a PDF
        for double-sided printing
        shouldn't require a 500-page manual.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to democratize professional print tools. We believe that efficient layout visualization and file
        preparation should be accessible to everyone,
        regardless of their technical expertise or budget.
    </p>

    <h2>What is "N-Up" Imposition?</h2>
    <p>
        N-Up imposition is the process of arranging multiple pages of a document onto a single sheet of paper. "N"
        stands for the number of pages.
        For example, "4-Up" means 4 pages are printed on one side of a sheet. This is crucial for efficient printing
        because it maximizes paper usage
        and speeds up the cutting process.
    </p>

    <h2>Why "Cut & Stack"?</h2>
    <p>
        The "Cut & Stack" naming comes from the specific layout method we use. Unlike "booklet" imposition where pages
        are arranged for folding,
        Cut & Stack is designed for single sheets (like flyers or business cards). It orders the pages so that once you
        cut the stack of paper,
        you can simply pile the cut stacks on top of each other, and the page numbers will automatically be in 1, 2,
        3... order.
